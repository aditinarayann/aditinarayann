# Python for DATA SCIENCE

## Exercises : 

Create a lambda function to classify flowers based on their petal length.
Use map to convert the Species column into numeric values:
Use value_counts on the Species column to count how many entries belong to each species.
Use drop_duplicates to remove any duplicate rows based on SepalLengthCm and PetalLengthCm.
Use astype to convert the SepalLengthCm column to a string type, then back to a float type. Gracefully handle any errors during the conversion.
Save the modified DataFrame to a CSV file using to_csv, ensuring the index is included.
Count the number of missing values in each column.
Replace missing values in the department column with "Unknown".
