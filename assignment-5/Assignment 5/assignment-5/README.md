# Python for DATA SCIENCE

## Exercises : 
1. How many annotations you have per month and year. Which month has more annotation files.
2. Create a dictionary where each **key** is a month, and the corresponding **value** is a list containing all the annotation names with where their date corresponds to the month. 
    a. Save it following the json format, and load it again to check that everything is ok.
    b. Save it this time using Pickle.
    c. Instead of storing a list of all the annotation names happening that month, let's create for each annotation a dictionary with keys: name and date (using a datetime object).
3. Print all the annotations from the oldest ones to the newest one during the seconf half of the 2024.
